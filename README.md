# Chronic Disease Management and Early Intervention Systems – Health Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and analyzing a data-driven Chronic Disease Management System tailored for underserved rural communities in Africa, with a special focus on hypertension and other non-communicable diseases.

Our goal was to bridge healthcare gaps through early detection, monitoring, and targeted intervention strategies, powered by predictive analytics, interactive data visualization, and screening tool deployment.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning and initial preprocessing
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn)**: Data analysis, machine learning model building
- **SQL**: Data extraction and querying
- **Power BI**: Dashboard development and data storytelling
- **Streamlit** (or appropriate framework): Screening App Development

## Key Contributions
- Cleaned and prepared a health dataset with over 311,000 entries.
- Implemented Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models to predict hypertension risk.
- Designed and built a **Hypertension Screening App** using the best-performing model (XGBoost) to assist healthcare workers in early risk detection.
- Identified key risk factors influencing hypertension such as stroke history, kidney disease, general health condition, diabetes, and smoking habits.
- Built a Power BI dashboard highlighting critical KPIs, risk distributions, and intervention priority areas.
- Proposed short-term and long-term public health intervention strategies targeting high-risk communities.

## Highlights
- **XGBoost model** achieved up to **90% accuracy** in hypertension prediction.
- Developed an **end-to-end predictive pipeline** and deployed a **screening app** for frontline health use.
- Created actionable, data-driven recommendations for health agencies and clinics.
